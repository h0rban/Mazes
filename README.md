# Mazes
Rectangular and Hexagonal Maze Construction and Solving vizualized with NU's [BigBang](https://course.ccs.neu.edu/cs2510h/image-doc.html) library in Java

This project was created following the instructions of the [assignment](https://github.com/h0rban/mazes/blob/master/assignment.pdf) for Northeastern's CS2510 Accelerated course. Maze construction is done with [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm) and solving is done with [Breadth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) and [Depth-first search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search). By instructor policy, the source code can only be made public by request.
